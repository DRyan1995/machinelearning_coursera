# Python Code for Coursera Machine Learning

This repo proivdes python-based solutions to the Coursera Machine Learning
course taught by professor Andrew NG.

In this first iteration, solutions mimic the MATLAB/Octave paradigm of matrix/vector
arithmetic to complete the exercises. In many cases, there are simpler and more 
'pythonic' ways to complete the exercises.
